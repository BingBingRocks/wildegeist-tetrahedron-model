# wildegeist-tetrahedron-model
A polarity-based directional logic model using tetrahedral geometry, inspired by flow systems like IPFS and Git.
# Wildegeist Tetrahedron Model

A conceptual model using tetrahedral geometry to represent directional data flow, polarity, and structural logic.

## ✨ Purpose

This model is designed to:
- Represent secure, verifiable flows of information or energy
- Prevent identity spoofing through directional and structural logic
- Map concepts in systems like Git, IPFS, Plan 9, and distributed trust models

## 🧠 Core Concept

The model uses **12 sticks** to form **4 triangular faces** of a tetrahedron.  
Each stick has:
- A **+ and − end** (polarity)
- A **flow direction**

Each triangle has:
- Structural dependencies
- Orientation rules
- A specific order of connection

Directional integrity depends on the correct alignment of all sticks and their endpoints.  
Disruption anywhere breaks the system.

## 🔧 Potential Applications
- Secure identity systems
- Data flow visualization
- Encryption frameworks
- Educational tools
- Conceptual art or philosophy

## 🗂️ Project Structure
## 💬 Status

Early concept stage.  
Contributions, feedback, and theoretical input welcome.
